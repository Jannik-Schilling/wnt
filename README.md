# Water Network Tools (WNT)
A set of QGIS processes for water network modelling.

## Capabilities
- Build a network topology and geometry from lines
- Split polylines at points, correcting models that ignore connection points (T, X, n-junctions)
- Add elevation to nodes from a dem
- Build an epanet model file from network
- build an epanet scenario file with pipe propierties (diameter and roughness)
- build an epanet scenario file with nodal demand
- build a pressurized pipe network optimizer (ppno) data file-
import an epanet file (nodes and link)

## Soon
- Load results
